# EasyPay

Let's attack this problem: College students have to make many daily transactions with other students and have no organized manner of doing so. This results in unnecessary complications and general inefficiency.

As a solution, we have created a text-based bot that processes individual and group texts via NLU to understand user intents to transfer money.

## API - IBM

* Leveraged IBM Watsonâ€™s Cloud Technology to analyze
user messages for transaction intent
* Utilized Knowledge Studio SDK to custom train
Machine Learning Model to tag entities in texts
* Used Natural Language Understanding SDK to process
texts and understand user intent

## API - Venmo

* Used PayPal/Venmo API to transfer money between
users when detecting user intent
* Leveraged the Venmo Pay and Request Procedures to
handle user transactions

## API - Nexmo

* Utilized API to read text messages between users
* Leveraged SMS platform to send confirmation texts
back to users upon successful transactions
* Processed group texts via Nexmo Group Handler
